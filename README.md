# Path-Finder
Visualize the difference between different path finding algorithms

1. Specify Start & End node
2. Mouse drag - build walls around the nodes
3. SPACEBAR - Begin search for path

## Dijkstra:
Searches nodes around it putting the least costing nodes high in priority
## A*:
searches nodes around it while also having a sense of direction towards the end, takes into account the distance to the end node while as well as the cost while prioritizing.



## Advanced Program settings:
If you'd like you could play around with more advanced settings of the program, following settings can be played around with in program.py.
- Dimensions (Rows, Cols)
- Diagonal Node cost (Changing node cost will effect prioritizing of the algorithm and makes it take interesting paths)
- Adjacent Node cost
- Width & Height of the screen
